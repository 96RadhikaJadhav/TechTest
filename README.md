# TechTest
TechTest is a mod for minetest, with what the players of Blocky Survival want.
# What does my mod do?

My mod adds currently:

- Fruit Snacks
- Candy
- Artificial Leather
- Beeswax
- Aluuminum (did i spell this wrong?)

# What will i add?

- Bauxite
- Pyrite
- Sulfur blocks
- More uses for sulfur (if i can find more uses for sulfur)
- Extractor
- Compressor (I probably won't add the ability to compress coal into diamonds, because everyone and @ViniProTheBro say that's a bad idea and an economy spoiler.)
# I'm not responsible for server or game crashes because i dont test this mod very often, so please test this mod first on a singleplayer world before updating.

# If you have an objection to what i've added or am planning to add, create an issue.

If you dont play on Blocky Survival, the players must agree to what you want befor i add it.
